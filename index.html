                    I grew up in a family that runs fashion & garments business.
                    At 14, I left my parents' house
                    to attend high school in Yangon (Rangoon).
                    Without even realizing what my  passion is, I ended up joining med school. I never
                    enjoyed it, but
                    I graduated in 2012 and practiced medicine for five years until I joined my wife, who is in the UK
                    working for the NHS as a
                    Specialist Registrar.

        <div class="content-wrapper">

                <span class="pitch">
                    <p>
                        Growing up in Myanmar, I was always passionate about engineering and architecture, largely
                        inspired by my uncle, who
                        was the only educated person I knew back then. Despite this passion, circumstances led me to
                        medical school, a journey I
                        didn't enjoy. I had serious doubts about my path, attempting to quit twice during my academic
                        years and once after
                        becoming a doctor. However, I met my wife during this time, which turned out to be the best &
                        highlight of this journey.
                        Consequently, I don’t regret joining medical school. After moving to the UK to join her via a
                        Spouse Visa, I
                        attempted to join the NHS, but unfortunately, it didn’t work out at the final stage. This
                        setback, coupled with unemployment, being a
                        stay-at-home husband, and the onset of the pandemic, had a significant impact on my mental
                        health; 2020 was the
                        toughest year of my life.
                    </p>

                    <p class="hide">
                        Determined to overcome these challenges, I took up jobs in retail in 2021 and grocery in 2022. I
                        decided to pursue a
                        career that genuinely excited me and resonated with my initial passion for problem-solving and
                        creation:
                        programming. I dedicated my free time to learning programming, self-studying using resources
                        like Harvard's CS50,
                        freeCodeCamp, Udemy, etc. However, with no one around to ask for help as I came from a different
                        background and being entirely new to the tech community, I found
                        myself stuck in “Tutorial Hells,” frequently experiencing Imposter Syndrome every now and then
                        but still learning alone with little progress. I then discovered Founders and Coders
                        (FAC) through the GOV.UK website and was inspired by the story of how it was founded by Dan. I
                        aspired to be one of those who
                        succeeded through this program.
                    </p>

                    <p class="hide">
                        Since May 2023, I’ve pushed myself out of my comfort zone by regularly and actively
                        participating in FAC meetups.
                        I’ve felt more alive and productive since joining these meetups, started to build real projects
                        not just tutorials, and my learning curve has increased exponentially
                        due to peer-to-peer learning. I even built my very first game, which was a challenging task for
                        me, especially as I
                        am more of an outdoors person. I find joy and a sense of belonging in the coding community,
                        something I didn't find
                        in medicine. I often find myself in a flow state while coding and sometimes lose track of time,
                        which I thoroughly
                        enjoy. To quote my senior, Manoela, from FAC cohort-25, who transitioned from being a primary
                        school teacher to
                        a developer, "I want to be <strong>HAPPY & TIRED</strong> too by doing what I love." I still
                        remember one of the
                        PowerPoint slides from my first FAC meetup on 23rd May stating, "We're not looking for perfect
                        applications, we're
                        looking for effort, commitment, and a solid understanding of basic Javascript." So, I tried not
                        to miss any FAC
                        meetups on Tuesdays and LIFT meetups on Wednesdays. Now, I think I've become one of those
                        applicants. I'm not
                        perfect yet, but with my eagerness to learn new things, adaptability, flexibility, effort, and
                        commitment, I am
                        ready to turn this passion into a professional career.
                    </p>

                    <span class="first-letter">Embarking</span><strong> my coding journey</strong>, I initially cut my
                    teeth on Harvard's renowned CS50 course. It was this rigorous
                    foundation that set the stage for my subsequent exploration into the realm of programming. As I am a
                    fan of Prof.David J. Malan, I finished CS50x, CS50P, CS50T and started CS50W. Since I decided to
                    apply for FAC programme, I worked hard to compete the tasks the applicants need to finish; I learnt
                    basic HTML, CSS and Javascript on freeCodeCamp and MDN(including documents), and tried to reach 6
                    kyu rank on Codewars. Throughout this journey, I relied heavily on various online resources,
                    including YouTube, W3Schools and with the help of mentors & peers from FAC meetups, of course. I
                    also sought assistance from AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Bing & Bard to clarify my
                    doubts and
                    strengthen my understanding. I have been attending Code Reading Club meetups at Space4 regularly
                    because I think that would be beneficial for my code reading skill.
